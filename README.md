Thanks for sharing your notebook 👍 Since `.ipynb` files don’t usually have a built-in README, I’ll create a **professional README.md** tailored for your project. I’ll assume this project is about **categorical data handling and testing on the UNSW dataset** (based on the filename you uploaded).

Here’s a ready-to-use `README.md`:

# UNSW Categorical Analysis – Final Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and testing categorical features of the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, a benchmark dataset widely used in **network security and intrusion detection research**.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Focused on **categorical preprocessing and evaluation** for the UNSW dataset.  
- Explores **encoding techniques, feature separation, and classification performance**.  
- Provides a reproducible framework for **testing categorical handling methods** on security-related data.
